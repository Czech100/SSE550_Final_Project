Getting Started
Step 1: Ensure Python is Installed
Make sure Python is installed on the system. You can verify this by running:
•	python –version
or
•	python3 –version
in the terminal (command prompt on Windows).
Step 2: Install Required Packages
The user needs to install the python packages tkinter, tkcalendar, and pillow:
1.	Tkinter is a GUI toolkit usually included with Python, so it might not have to be installed. If the GUI toolkit needs to be installed, the user can install it using a packaged manager.
--a.	Windows:
----i.	On Windows, Tkinter is included with the standard Python installation from python.org. If you've installed Python from there, you should already have Tkinter.
--b.	Linux:
---i.	On Linux, you can install Tkinter using the distribution’s package manager. For example:
------1.	On Debian/Ubuntu:
--------a.	sudo apt-get install python3-tk
------2.	On Fedora:
--------a.	sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
------3.	On CentOS:
--------a.	sudo yum install python3-tkinter
--c.	macOS:
----i.	On macOS, Tkinter is also included with the standard Python installation from python.org. If you're using Homebrew, it should also include Tkinter when you install Python:
------1.	brew install python
2.	PIL(Python Imaging Library)/Pillow: This is used for image processing tasks, like loading and displaying images in your GUI. Pillow is an updated fork of PIL and can be installed via pip:
a.	pip install pillow
3.	tkcalendar: This package provides the calendar widget used in your application. You can install it using pip:
a.	pip install tkcalendar
Step 3: Obtain the Program Files
The user can retrieve the program files from the GitHub page, https://github.com/Czech100/SSE550_Final_Project. 
Step 4: Navigate to the Program Directory
Using a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the program files are saved. For example:
•	cd path/to/program/directory
Step 5: Run the Program
Execute the main Python script ( ‘main.py’ ) using Python. 
Run:
•	python main.py 
or
•	python3 main.py
This should launch the application’s GUI.
Step 6: Using the Application
Once the application starts, the user can interact with the GUI to schedule, view, or cancel appointments as per the functionalities provided.
